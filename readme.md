# Markdown Site with PHP

**This project makes it easy to create a small website from a collection of Markdown files.** Unlike static site generators, HTML is generated dynamically from markdown files when pages are requested, so there is no need for a build step.

### Features
* Automatic anchor links for headings
* Syntax highlighting in code blocks
* Styled to resemble GitHub using Bootstrap
* Add a table of contents using `![](TOC)`
* Embed YouTube videos using `![](YouTubeURL)`
* page URLs are clear folder paths (not filenames)

### Title and Meta

> **⚠️ Warning:** This feature is under active development

```
TODO: Markdown headers are coming...
      These will let the user define page titles
      and customize things like ad display page-by-page.
```

## Developer Notes

### Installation

**Step 1:** Copy the `wwwroot` folder to your website 

(that's it)

### Develop in Docker

This repository has a ready-to-run demo site. 

Run `docker-compose up -d` and go to http://localhost:8081

### Routing Requests

This repository uses `.htaccess` to tell Apache (with mod_rewrite) to route requests to a folder containing an `index.md` to `route.php`. If you don't use Apache or mod_rewrite, use whatever system you do have to route directory index requests similarly.

### Extending this Work

This bare bones website was designed to be extended for special needs such as:

* **Pagination:** For example, [my blog](http://swharden.com) supports tags, pagination, and more.

* **Conversion to a static HTML site:** A static site could be generated by saving the generated page as `index.html` for every folder.

* **Automatic thumbnails:** If `![](x.jpg)` is referenced but both `x.jpg` and `x_thumb.jpg` exist, the thumbnail will be shown but the link will point to the full size image.
