# Started Transmitting Letters

I finished writing the [microcontroller code to read the GPS time](https://github.com/swharden/QRSS-hardware/tree/master/builds/keyer) and only start transmissions when the minutes value ends with a zero. The signal now stacks nicely in 10-minute grabs. Now that GPS and the oven is working well I've started sending my call sign (AJ4VD).

### AJ4VD spotted in Pensacola, FL (W4HBK) 

First spot occurred while I was actively adjusting the transmission length

5x frame stack (mean frame) from the WD4ELG grabber reveals the AJ4VD signal much better, and confirms the GPS timer is working well.
