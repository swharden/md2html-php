# Hello, World!

This page was dynamically generated using **Markdown** - Congratulations!

Click _view source_ at the bottom of the article to check the Markdown code

### Simple: Folders are Web Pages

* Folders containing `index.md` are served as a web page.
* Examples are in the _Sample Sites_ section.

### Advanced: Blog with pagination

* 100s of blog post articles are in `blog`.
* `blog/Blog.php` has code that extends md2html to support pagination, tags, rss feed, and more.
* All this complexity is not required. Just delete the `Blog` folder and it's gone!

### Special Markdown

  * `![](TOC)` adds a table of contents
  * `![](https://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0)` embeds a YouTube video
