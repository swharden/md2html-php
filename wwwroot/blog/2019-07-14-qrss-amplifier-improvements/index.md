# Amplifier Improvements

I improved my amplifier (now output 500mW) and am impressed how well my attic dipole is doing! It runs east/west so it radiates north/south. I saw my signal on a few more grabbers.

### AJ4VD spotted in Pensacola, FL (W4HBK)

This 8-hour grab reveals when my AC kicks on and off and demonstrates the necessity of ovenizing my setup. It's the signal around 10,139,980 Hz.
