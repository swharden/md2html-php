# A Change in Symptoms

**My first realization that something was changing** in the status of my disease came while filming a YouTube video about FTDI microchips. I noticed the cervical lymph nodes on my left side were swollen, took a selfie to assess what they looked like, then kept shooting the video with my body turned in such a way as to minimize the notability of my left neck.

**That picture was taken May 29 2018, and at my next doctor visit was 8 days later.** The oncologist was concerned about the progression and ordered additional imaging (a CT) to get a better idea of what may be changing.

## A History of my Cancer

It's been a few years since I've written about this, so here's the story.

**In April 2012 I had some alarming symptoms** (lymphadenopathy, weight loss, night sweats) and visited an oncologist for the first time. This picture was taken just before my first doctor visit, and I’m in scrubs because I was a dental student at the time (I hadn’t started the DMD/PhD program yet). After several blood tests and two surgical biopsies I was eventually diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). More specifically, Lennert’s Lymphoma, a rare lymphoepithelioid variant of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in the not otherwise specified category T-cell lymphomas.

Of interest is one of K. Lennert’s [early publications](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/68/3/663.full.pdf) from 1986 (there are earlier ones, but this one is open-access). Its title describes condition as “a monoclonal proliferation of helper T cells“, and in its text further characterizes it as “special variant of Hodgkin’s disease characterized by a high percentage of epithelioid cells and rarely containing the Reed-Sternberg cells characteristic of classical Hodgkin’s disease.”
