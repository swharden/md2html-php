# First Round of Chemotherapy

**I started my first round of chemotherapy today!** I expect to feel pretty lousy for the first few days after each infusion (the next one being 3 weeks from now), but Iâ€™m very happy that treatment has begun.

**The chemotherapy regimen I am undergoing is called CHOP,** an acronym for the combination of drugs used: The **C** (cyclophosphamide) is an alkylating antineoplastic agent which damages DNA by promoting the formation of interstrand and intrastrand crosslinkages leading to cell death. The **H** (hydroxydaunorubicin, or doxorubicin) is another DNA damaging drug which inserts itself between DNA bases and prevents the progression of topoisomerase II (which relaxes super-coils of DNA so it can be read or replicated), leading to cell death. The **O** (Oncovin, or Vincristine) binds to tubulin (the primary molecule comprising the cytoskeleton). During metaphase (when all the chromosomes are lined up and about to separate) the separation of chromosomes into two daughter cells is prevented, and an apoptotic pathway is activated killing the cell. Finally, **P** (prednisone) is a glucocorticoid immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drug commonly used alongside antineoplastic agents to reduce the likelihood of allergic reactions and to alleviate some of their side effects. Although these drugs seem like blunt instruments (broad spectrum DNA and cytoskeleton-damaging chemicals), rapidly growing cells (such as the tumors being targeted by this chemotherapy) are preferentially targeted for damage, resulting in the efficacy of this treatment. Other fast-growing cell types are damaged as the result of these drugs, one of which live within hair follicles. As such I expect to begin losing my hair at some point over the next couple of weeks.
