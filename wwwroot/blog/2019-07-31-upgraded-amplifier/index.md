# Upgraded Amplifier

The design is similar (CMOS buffer driving an IRF510) but I used perfboard to make this one and placed it in an enclosure. There's no low-pass filter on the amplifier itself, but I put a 30m low-pass filter in-line the coax before the antenna. It's currently outputting 20PPV into 50 ohms (1 watt).

Right after hooking it up I saw my signal looking nice on the air:
