# QRSS Stitch and Stack

If the transmitter frequency is stable, transmissions start every 10 minutes, and grabbers are time-aligned to be every 10 minutes, multiple grabs can be averaged together to enhance signal-to-noise ratio. This is called QRSS Image Stacking. To simplify the process of making these images I created a new tool for the job: [QRSS Stitch and Stack](https://github.com/swharden/QRSS-Stich-and-Stack).
