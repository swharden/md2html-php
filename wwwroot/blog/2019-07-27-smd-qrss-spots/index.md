# SMT QRSS Spots

This page documents interesting grabs of the signal from my [SMT QRSS Transmitter](https://swharden.com/blog/2019-07-26-smt-qrss-design/)

### Nova Scotia, Canada (VE1VDM)

I was really strong on VE1VDM's grabber last night, but I found it interesting to see such a strong signal in the middle of the day (11AM).

I spotted my signal across the Atlantic. It's pretty weak, but you can just make out the unique shape on EA8BVP's grabber in the Canary Islands (4,000 miles away).

I spotted my signal in Switzerland

[Bill (W4HBK)](https://www.qsl.net/w4hbk/) emailed the [QRSS Knights](https://groups.io/g/qrssknights) a grab of my signal from a KIWI SDR captured at HB9EHO in Ittigen, Switzerland.
